## The Structure

A generalization of binary search trees and similar to B+ Trees, Fractal Tree Indexes are a write-optimized data structure with buffers at each node that store instructions for inserts and deletions to be processed in batches, therefore reducing I/O operations and avoiding the worst-case complexity of B+ Trees.
